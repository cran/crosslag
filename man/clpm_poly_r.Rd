\usage{
clpm_poly_r(xname, yname, data1, data2, adjust = FALSE, adjust_name = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{xname}{If cross lagged analysis is used between x and y, 'xname' is the name of x}

\item{yname}{If cross lagged analysis is used between x and y, 'xname' is the name of x}

\item{data1}{A dataframe containing data of x and y at the same time point.
If covariate adjustments are made (adjust=T), data of covariates should also be included.
The input 'xname','yname' and 'adjust_name' is written in the same way among the 'data1' column names}

\item{data2}{A dataframe containing data of x and y at the another time point.
If covariate adjustments are made (adjust=T), data of covariates should also be included.
The input 'xname','yname' and 'adjust_name' is written in the same way among the 'data2' column names}

\item{adjust}{The default value is F.
If you want to perform covariate adjustments on x and y based on adjust_target(), please use T.}

\item{adjust_name}{The name of the covariate, corresponding to the data contained in data1 or data2.
If there are multiple covariates, they need to be saved in a vector.}
}
\value{
A dataframe containing the result of Nonlinear Cross Lag Analysis after polynomial regression: Xt~X1,Yt~Y1
